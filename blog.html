        <p>Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind. (He runs inside his house and shuts the door behind him.) (to himself) Science Fiction Theater. (George's Room - Night)No, Monday be fine... you can kill him on Monday. (to Marty) I'll be back this way on Monday. We'll settle this then. Right there out in the street, in front of the Palace Saloon. Yeah, right, well, when? (sarcastically) High noon? Noon? I do my killin' before breakfast. Seven o'clock! (tries to put up a brave front) Eight o'clock. (again gaining confidence) I do my killin' after breakfast.(Biff wakes up again.) Where is he? Who? Calvin Klein. Who?(Delgato Mine) (Doc and Marty blow open the entrance to the mine.) Whoa. I think you woke up the dead with that blast. Take this camera... I want to document everything! (Delgato Mine - Inside)That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Well gee, I don't know. And he could sleep in my room. (she grabs Marty's thigh under the table.) (jumps up) I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. (leaves) He's a very strange young man.What, what? Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)…tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Yeah okay. Oh.Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. I haven't. You okay, is everything alright? Aw yeah, everything is great.
