That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... (A man throws a newspaper away and Marty picks it up and sees the date as November 5th, 1955.) This has gotta be a dream. (He spots a coffee shop and goes in.) (Coffee Shop)(The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. (Doc pulls down his glasses.)</p>
