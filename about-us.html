        <h3 class="title"> Our Training methods:</h3>
        <p> (Marty lifts the girl off her scooter.) Hey! (breaks off the handlebars) Look, I need to borrow your...hoverboard? (Griff’s gang run out of the café.) Where is he?"Ronald Reagan"Welcome to the Café 80's, where it's always morning in America, even in the aftern..n..noon. Our special today is mesquite-grilled sushi, Cajun style… (The screen is "interrupted" by another video waiter on the same video. This one looks like the Ayatollah Khomeini.) "Ayatollah Khomeini"You must try the hot Satan special! (The two waiters begin arguing amongst themselves.) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (The video waiters shut up.) All I want is a Pepsi.As for you, I’ll be back up here in an hour, so you'd better not be! (Biff leaves, slamming the doors as he goes. 3-D, Match and Skinhead follow him.) He was right, and I was wrong. Mom, Mom, what are you saying? You're actually defending him! (Lorraine sits down and has another drink.)(Marty is trying to get Doc to drink the coffee, but it's not working.) You want to sober him up in a hurry, son, you're gonna have to use something a lot stronger than coffee. Yeah, what do you suggest? (smiles) Joey. Let's make some wake up juice. (They pull out several ingredients. The Bartender pours a little of everything into a glass.)Hey Biff, she's all fixed up just like you wanted, but I couldn't get it started! You got some kind of a kill switch on this thing? (The camera pulls out to reveal 2015 Biff behind a tree. He watches as 1955 Biff opens the car door and gets in.) No, you just got to have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me. The bill comes to $302 and 57 cents... 300 bucks? (He gets out of the car.) 300 bucks for a couple of dents? No, hey, that's bullshit Terry.Ahh. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Ohh, no. No, Doc. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. </p>

    <div class="info">
        <h3 class="title"> About the farm:</h3>
        <p>Just finishing up the second coat now. Now Biff, don't con me. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. That Biff, what a character. (goes back inside) Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him… We never would have fallen in love.(The others laugh) (to Marty) What'll it be, stranger? Uh...I'll have...uh...ice water. Ice water? (laughs) Water? You want water, you better go dunk your head in the horse trawl back there. (The old men laugh) In here... we pour whiskey. (He takes out a bottle of whiskey and pours a small glass. Marty stares at it. There is steam coming from the glass.)(Marty arrives in time to see a Tow Truck driving up with what's left of his Dad's Car. Inside Biff Tannen is griping at George McFly, Marty's father. George is a skinny man, and very nerdy.) I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blind spot before when I would drive it. (spots Marty) Hi, son. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. What's a rerun? You'll find out.</p>

        <h3 class="title"> What our graduates have acomplished:</h3>
        <p> There's going to be plenty of rain all right. Wind, thunder, lightning. It's going to be one hell of a storm. Well, thanks. Nice talking to you. Maybe we'll bump into each other some time again in the future. Or in the past. (1985 Doc gets on his bike and ride off, ringing his bell. 1955 Doc looks up. That ring sounded very familiar!) (High School)Wrong! See I was on my horse when he threw his shoe and I got throwed off. And that just caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky Redeye. So the way I figure, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey, and seventy-five dollars for the horse. (realizing) That's eighty dollars! Look, if your horse threw his shoe, bring him back and I'll re-shoe him! I done shot that horse! Well that's your problem, Tannen!Thanks, Biff. (Jennifer's House) (Marty pulls up outside of Jennifer's house. Jennifer is still sleeping on the swing on the porch.) Jennifer. Jen. Jennifer. Wake up. (Marty sits beside her on the swing. She hasn't stirred yet. He gently touches her cheek. He bends down and kisses her. Her eyes open and she smiles.) </p>

    <div class="info">
        <h3 class="title"> Who we are:</h3>
        <p>Marty you gotta come back with me. Where? Back to the future. (Doc goes over to the garbage can and starts digging through it.) Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?(Marty and Lorraine arrive at the dance. Marty's very nervous.) Do you mind if we park for a while? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Huh? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.Buford, you sure that blacksmith is gonna be at this here shindig? Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight. You gentlemen are gonna have to check your firearms if you want to join in on the festivities. (laughs) And who's gonna make us, tender-foot...you? I am. (Buford turns to see Marshall Strickland with a rifle aimed at Buford's shoulder.)(As he stares, puzzled, Jennifer takes out the Cusco FAX she brought home from the future earlier and watches as the text, "YOU'RE FIRED!!!", vanishes from the page.) (in an awed whisper) It erased. (Train Tracks) (Marty and Jennifer are looking at what's left of the Delorean.) You're right. There's not much left.Give us our ball back! What ball? That ball! What ball are you talking about? Give us our ball back!</p>
