        <h3 class="title"> Our Training methods:</h3>
        <p>  Yeah. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Working. Where's Einstein, is he with you? Yeah, he's right here.(Marty punches this information into the keypad.) (into walkie-talkie) We're cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc. (into walkie-talkie) I'm throwing in the Presto Logs. (He throws the logs into the fire, one by one.) (into walkie-talkie) Marty, the new gauge will show the boiler temperature. (In the Delorean Marty looks at the new device Doc has installed.) The color coding indicates when each log will fire. Green, yellow, and red. Each detonation will be accompanied by a sudden burst of acceleration. Hopefully we'll get up to 88 miles per hour before the needle hits two thousand.Hey, look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit! (laughs) No, this is for your coffin. My coffin?! Well, the odds are running two to one against you. Might as well be prepared. (he walks off) So...it may not be my name that's supposed to end up on that tombstone. It may be yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
        <h3 class="title"> About the farm:</h3>
        <p>Say that again. I said the keys are in here. (Parking Lot) (George runs out to the car where Loraine is and jerks the car door open.) Hey you, get your damn hands off…(sees that it's BifF) oh.(Doc is reading the letter out loud.) "If my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the Delorean struck by lightning. First, let me assure you that I am alive and well. I have been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885. The lightning bolt that hit the Delorean caused a jigowatt overload which scrambled the time circuits, activated the flux capacitor, and sent me back to 1885. The overload shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits. Unfortunately, the car will never fly again." (He pauses and looks at Marty in amazement.) It actually flew! Yeah, well, you had a hover conversion done in the early twenty-first century. Incredible! (goes back to reading.) "I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits. Unfortunately, this proved impossible because suitable replacement parts will not be invented until 1947. However, I've gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons!" (Doc turns to Marty again.) 1885! Amazing. I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Old West. Grinning. Pretty heavy, huh?(Lorraine puts the pizza on the table.) Here you go. (Marty, Marlene and Marty Jr. all take a slice. Marlene and Marty Jr. both have television/telephone goggles on.) Oh boy, oh boy Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza. (Marty takes a bite.) Now I'm sorry I missed that whole thing. (Hallway)</p>

        <h3 class="title"> What our graduates have acomplished:</h3>
        <p> (Data plays a chicken sound effect. Marty freezes and turns around to face Griff.) What'd you call me, Griff? Chicken, McFly. (The sound effects of a chicken play again.) Nobody calls me....(He sees Griff's bat.) …chicken. (smiles faintly, a sort of "oops" smile)That's Mrs. McFly, and don't you be forgettin' the misses! And what might your name be sir? Well, it's Mc…(he stops suddenly realizing that he shouldn't tell her his real name.) Eastwood...uh...Clint...Clint Eastwood? (grins sheepishly) You hit your head, Mr. Eastwood. Not too serious, but lucky for you, Seamus found you when he did. Seamus? Me husband. You'll be excuse me Mr. East-wood, while I tend to William.Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there all the way to the right. Yeah, turn it all the way around. Okay let's go! (The machine continues to work. Doc holds a pan next to a pipe. Suddenly a small brownish square shoots out. Doc picks it up with some tongs and drops it into a beaker of tea. He rattles it and offers it to Marty.) Iced tea? No, thanks. (Doc takes a drink and then sets the beaker down. Marty looks at the machine with a new-found respect for the Doc.) It's a refrigerator! (moves off) Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation. Turning to face Marty. If I never meet the woman, there's no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right?No it can't be you...I just sent you back to the future! I know, you did send me back to the future, but I'm back! I'm back from the future! Great Scott! (He faints.) Doc. C'mon. </p>

        <h3 class="title"> Who we are:</h3>
        <p>Careful old timer, this is a rough neighborhood. Just give me the receipt. Here it is. (Biff takes it and the taxi flies off. Biff hides in a recycling station just behind the DeLorean.) (McFly Residence)(The DeLorean hits 88mph and lets off blue flashes - it's about ready to travel through time. Cut to Doc. Doc gets the cable out of the branch. Lightning strikes it, and the lightning causes electricity to go down the cables, which Doc reconnects just in time, getting himself a slight electric shock as he does so.) Ahh! (The lightning enters the flux capacitor. 1955 Marty gets sent back to 1985. Doc dances with delight because the experiment was successful.) Yoo! It works! Ha, ha, ha! (And then he turns to the Courthouse. After looking at it, he turns to his car - and 1985 Marty comes running up to him.) Doc! Doc! Doc! What? Doc!Why, you're right. I presume you're conducting some sort of weather experiment. That's right. How did you know that? Oh, I happen to have a little experience in this area. Yes, well, I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight, although the weatherman says there is not going to be any rain.(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>
